# Coffee Shop App

Hello everyone,

I am a beginner developer exploring SwiftUI by creating applications for a coffee shop. I've opened up this project so anyone interested can follow along and see my progress.

There will be more projects on my GitHub as I continue to improve my skills. In the future, I hope to create a space where beginner developers can collaborate on projects together. 

For now, feel free to watch and share your thoughts.

Thank you!
